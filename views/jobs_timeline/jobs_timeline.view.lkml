# Views based on the following tables: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/information-schema-jobs-timeline
# The tables are different in scope, but all contain 1 row per job x time period. Essentially, a row for every second that a job was running
# This is similar to the timeline array nested within the jobs table, but flattened
# For slot usage analysis, this is more expensive to query at the job level, but is more accurate for fine time granularities
