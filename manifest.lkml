constant: MAX_JOB_LOOKBACK {
  # The maximum amount of time to look backwards in job data to find jobs that may still be open in a filtered window of slot usage
  # (This is necessary because detailed slot usage data is in job steps or job timelines, but are partitioned by job creation time.
  #  So, a job created at 11:30 that runs for 1 hour should affect slots usage between 12:00-4:00, but for performance reasons we want to limit how far back
  #  we'll scan for these long-running jobs)
  # Here's a query to help set a max based on your longest running jobs: /explore/bigquery_information_schema_custom/jobs?fields=duration_hr,jobs.start_time_date,jobs.job_id,jobs.project_id&f[date.date_filter]=181+days&sorts=duration_hr+desc&limit=25&column_limit=50&vis=%7B%7D&filter_config=%7B%22date.date_filter%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22past%22%2C%22values%22%3A%5B%7B%22constant%22%3A%22181%22%2C%22unit%22%3A%22day%22%7D%2C%7B%7D%5D%2C%22id%22%3A5%2C%22error%22%3Afalse%7D%5D%7D&dynamic_fields=%5B%7B%22dimension%22%3A%22duration_hr%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Duration+%28hr%29%22%2C%22expression%22%3A%22%24%7Bjobs.duration_s%7D+%2F+3600%22%2C%22value_format%22%3Anull%2C%22value_format_name%22%3A%22decimal_1%22%2C%22_kind_hint%22%3A%22dimension%22%2C%22_type_hint%22%3A%22number%22%7D%5D&origin=share-expanded.
